/*
 int is a series of 1s and 0s that represent 32-bit numbers
 NSInteger is a series of 1s and 0s that can be either a 32-bit integer or a 64-bit integer depending on the CPU
 NSNumber for storing numbers (its an object)
 NSInteger holds only integer
 NSNumber can hold int, NSInteger, floats, doubles, and even booleans
 NSNumber: a class that serves to wrap each of those number types in an object so that we can put them into arrays, dictionaries, sets, and other places that require objects
